I was given most of the code for this file.  What I created was the learning algorithm and implemented it.  

Computer scientists study and develop solutions to problems using computers and computational techniques. 
They work on a wide range of areas, including developing algorithms, designing and analyzing systems, creating software applications, and researching new technologies.

I would start by understanding the problem and breaking it down.  Once I have gone through the problem I would create and implamenbt a solution.  
The next step would be to test the solution and optimize it if needed.  Then document the solution so others will be able to read it.

My Ethical responsibilities are protecting user privacy, and ensuring system reliability.
